## Understanding Actions

Actions in Viber3D (powered by Koota) are **centralized functions** that modify the ECS world. They help avoid scattering spawn/remove/update logic in multiple places.

```ts
import { createActions } from 'koota'
import { IsPlayer, Health, Transform } from '../traits'

export const actions = createActions((world) => ({
  spawnPlayer: (position) => {
    return world.spawn(
      IsPlayer(),
      Transform({ position }),
      Health({ amount: 100 })
    )
  },
  destroyAllPlayers: () => {
    world.query(IsPlayer).forEach((player) => {
      player.destroy()
    })
  }
}))
```

## Using Actions in React

With `useActions`, you get your action functions bound to the current `world`:

```tsx
import { useActions } from 'koota/react'
import { actions } from '../actions'

function GameController() {
  const { spawnPlayer, destroyAllPlayers } = useActions(actions)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Spawn a player on mount
    spawnPlayer({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 })

    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => destroyAllPlayers()
  }, [])
  
  return null
}
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Centralize**: Store all your actions in a dedicated file (e.g. `src/actions.ts` or `actions/` folder).
2. **Keep them pure**: Actions should only modify the ECS state; avoid large side effects.
3. **Descriptive names**: Use clear naming like `spawnEnemyWave()`, `applyDamage()`, etc.
4. **Cleanup logic**: Provide actions to remove entities or reset traits as needed.

## Action Composition

Actions can call one another to build complex flows:

```ts
export const actions = createActions((world) => ({
  spawnEnemy: (position) => {
    return world.spawn(IsEnemy(), Transform({ position }), Health({ amount: 50 }))
  },
  spawnEnemyWave: (count) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      const position = getRandomPosition()
      actions.spawnEnemy(position) // calling another action
    }
  }
}))
```

---

## Conditional Updates

```ts
export const actions = createActions((world) => ({
  damageEntity: (entity, amount) => {
    if (entity.has(Health)) {
      entity.set(Health, (h) => {
        const newAmount = Math.max(0, h.amount - amount)
        if (newAmount <= 0) {
          actions.destroyEntity(entity)
        }
        return { ...h, amount: newAmount }
      })
    }
  },
  destroyEntity: (entity) => entity.destroy()
}))
```

---

## Testing Actions

Actions are straightforward to test. You can create a test world, apply your action, and inspect the result:

```ts
describe('playerActions', () => {
  let world: World
  let boundActions: ReturnType<typeof actions>

  beforeEach(() => {
    world = createWorld()
    boundActions = actions.bindTo(world)
  })

  it('spawnPlayer creates a player entity', () => {
    const player = boundActions.spawnPlayer({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 })
    expect(player.has(IsPlayer)).toBe(true)
    expect(player.has(Health)).toBe(true)
  })

  it('destroyAllPlayers removes all player entities', () => {
    boundActions.spawnPlayer({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 })
    boundActions.spawnPlayer({ x: 1, y: 0, z: 0 })
    boundActions.destroyAllPlayers()
    expect(world.query(IsPlayer).length).toBe(0)
  })
})
```

## Summary

Actions let you organize all your ECS modifications into a single, testable locationâ€”helping maintain clarity and consistency throughout your codebase.

- Integrate [Actions in React](#using-actions-in-react) via `useActions`.
- Combine with [Systems](./4.systems.md) for runtime logic and [Traits](./3.traits.md) for the data definition.
- Keep your ECS usage clean, predictable, and well-structured.
