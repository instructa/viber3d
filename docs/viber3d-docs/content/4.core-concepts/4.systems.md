## Introduction

In ECS, **Systems** are the logic executors. They run over queries of entities that have the required traits, performing operations such as movement, AI, physics, or effects.

```ts
import { World } from 'koota'
import { Transform, Movement } from '../traits'

function movementSystem(world: World) {
  // Example: let's assume we have a Time trait
  const time = world.get(Time)
  if (!time) return

  const { delta } = time
  world.query(Transform, Movement).updateEach(([transform, movement]) => {
    transform.position.add(movement.velocity.clone().multiplyScalar(delta))
  })
}
```

## Core Patterns

### Update Systems

Most systems run every frame (or every tick). They typically:
1. Retrieve relevant data from the world (e.g., `Time`, `Input`).
2. Query entities matching a specific trait combination.
3. Update trait data as needed.

```ts
function healthRegenSystem(world: World) {
  const time = world.get(Time)!
  world.query(Health, Regeneration).updateEach(([health, regen]) => {
    health.amount = Math.min(health.max, health.amount + regen.rate * time.delta)
  })
}
```

### Event Systems

Sometimes, you only want to process logic when an event happens. Koota has an event system:

```ts
world.on('entityDamaged', ({ entity, amount }) => {
  // maybe spawn a blood effect or play a sound
})
```

You can emit events in your code:

```ts
entity.set(Health, (h) => {
  const newAmount = Math.max(0, h.amount - damage)
  world.emit('entityDamaged', { entity, amount: damage })
  return { ...h, amount: newAmount }
})
```

### Cleanup Systems

Systems that remove entities or reset them:

```ts
function cleanupSystem(world: World) {
  world.query(Health).removeIf(([health]) => health.amount <= 0)
}
```

## System Organization

Generally, you have a `systems/` directory with one file per system or small system groups. In your main loop (or React’s `useFrame`), you call them in order:

```ts
export function GameLoop(world: World) {
  // Possibly in a requestAnimationFrame or React useFrame
  timeSystem(world)
  inputSystem(world)
  movementSystem(world)
  collisionSystem(world)
  cleanupSystem(world)
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Cache queries**: Repeatedly calling the same query can be more expensive. If you must query the same traits many times, store the result.
2. **Use SoA**: For large numeric datasets, prefer schema-based traits for better performance.
3. **Selective Scheduling**: Not every system needs to run every frame (e.g., AI pathfinding might run less often).

## Change Detection Options

When using `.updateEach()`, you can specify how Koota handles change events:

- `changeDetection: 'never'` — no change events triggered.
- `changeDetection: 'always'` — changes are always emitted for mutated traits.
- (default) — triggers changes only for traits or queries specifically tracking them.

```ts
world.query(Position, Velocity).updateEach(
  ([pos, vel]) => {
    // ...
  },
  { changeDetection: 'never' }
)
```

## Testing Systems

Because systems are just functions, you can test them easily:

```ts
describe('movementSystem', () => {
  it('updates position based on velocity', () => {
    const world = createWorld()
    const ent = world.spawn(Transform(), Movement({ velocity: new Vector3(1, 0, 0) }))
    world.add(Time({ delta: 1 })) // simulate 1 second

    movementSystem(world)
    expect(ent.get(Transform)!.position.x).toBe(1)
  })
})
```
