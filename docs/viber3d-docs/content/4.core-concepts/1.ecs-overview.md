## What is ECS?

ECS stands for **Entity Component System**, a data-driven architecture widely used in games:
- **Entities** are unique identifiers that represent in-game objects (e.g., players, enemies, bullets).
- **Traits** (often called components in other ECSs) hold pure data for those entities.
- **Systems** process matching entities to implement logic and behavior.

Koota is the ECS-based library that Viber3D uses under the hood. It’s optimized for real-time apps and XR experiences.

## Why ECS?

1. **Flexibility**  
   Entities can have any combination of traits—much more flexible than rigid inheritance trees.

2. **Performance**  
   ECS focuses on data-oriented design, allowing efficient queries and updates to large numbers of entities.

3. **Maintainability**  
   By separating data (traits) from logic (systems), your codebase remains organized and easy to reason about.

4. **Composability**  
   New features or behaviors can be added by creating new traits and systems without modifying existing code.

## ECS in Viber3D

Below is a simplified example:

```ts
import { trait, createWorld } from 'koota'

// 1. Define traits (data)
export const Position = trait({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 })
export const Health = trait({ amount: 100 })

// 2. Create a world and spawn an entity
const world = createWorld()
world.spawn(Position({ x: 10, y: 5 }), Health({ amount: 50 }))

// 3. Query and update entities
world.query(Position, Health).updateEach(([pos, hp]) => {
  // game logic that modifies position or health
})
```

## SoA vs. AoS Storage

Koota supports two main ways of storing trait data:

- **Schema-based (SoA)**: If you define a trait with an object literal, each property is stored in its own array. Ideal for numeric fields updated frequently (e.g., positions, velocities).
  
  ```ts
  const Position = trait({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 })
  // Internally, x, y, and z each become separate arrays
  ```

- **Callback-based (AoS)**: If you define a trait with a callback, the entire trait is stored as a single object in an array of structures. Useful when storing complex objects (e.g., `THREE.Mesh`, classes, or vectors).

  ```ts
  const Mesh = trait(() => new THREE.Mesh())
  // Each entity that has Mesh gets its own THREE.Mesh() instance
  ```

## World Traits

In Koota, your `World` can also have traits (sometimes called “singleton” traits). These do **not** appear in standard entity queries but can be accessed with `world.get(...)` and `world.set(...)`. Use them for global data like time, input state, or configuration.

```ts
import { trait, createWorld } from 'koota'

const Time = trait({ delta: 0, current: 0 })
const world = createWorld()
world.add(Time)

// Now we can store time info globally
world.set(Time, (prev) => ({
  current: performance.now(),
  delta: performance.now() - prev.current
}))
```

## Common Patterns

- **Composition over inheritance**: Build complex entities by combining small, focused traits.
- **Use queries efficiently**: Only query for traits you need.
- **Clean up**: Remove or destroy entities when they’re no longer needed (e.g., after a system determines they’re off-screen or at zero health).
