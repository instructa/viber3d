# Contributing to Viber3D

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Viber3D! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to the project.

## Project Structure

Viber3D is organized as a monorepo with multiple packages:

- `viber3d` - The main package published to npm

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/instructa/viber3d.git
   cd viber3d
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the packages:
   ```bash
   pnpm build:packages
   ```

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main`
2. Make your changes and ensure all tests pass
3. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch
4. Ensure your PR has a clear description of the changes and why they're needed

For larger features, consider opening an issue first to discuss the approach.

## Templates

Viber3D provides different templates for project initialization. These templates are stored in the `templates` directory of the repository.

- The default template is the `starter` template
- The `starter-next` template (accessed via the `next` branch) contains upcoming features and changes

When developing new templates or making changes to existing ones, you can test them locally by using the `--template` flag with the CLI:

```bash
npx viber3d@latest init my-game --template next
```

This will use the experimental template from `templates/starter-next` on the `next` branch.

## Coding Standards

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation for any changes to the API or functionality

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commit messages to make the commit history more readable and to automate versioning:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` - Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or correcting tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Need Help?

If you need help with contributing, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to the maintainers.
